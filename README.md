Library for integration with the [WP-API](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/). Embryonic project created to integrate with the WP-API easy way.

I have not met the WP-API? You may see the following guides.

* [Getting Started][]: Begin working with the API, and learn how to access basic
  post data.
* [Working with Posts][]: Explore more advanced usage of post-related data,
  including filtering and additional data.
* [Extending the API][]: Create your own API routes and endpoints in a plugin.

[Getting Started]: getting-started.md
[Working with Posts]: working-with-posts.md
[Extending the API]: extending.md
